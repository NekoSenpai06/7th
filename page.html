         <p style="float: left;">Dear baby gabi,</p><br><br>
         <p>Distance may separate us physically, but our hearts are connected forever kahit na from the start pa lang strong na tayoâ€” our love keeps growing stronger with each passing month, remember that I will not get tired of loving you, forever na to baby but I just hope na sana hindi ka mag sawang mahalin ako even though sometimes I'm hurting you. I may not be the best but I promise you to fulfill all my promises to you. I hope that this relationship will last and stay even stronger, forever. I love you, gabi, with all i am.</p><br>
         <p>I love you so much!</p>
